# Payload CMS Application Development

Payload is a Next.js native CMS with TypeScript-first architecture, providing admin panel, database management, REST/GraphQL APIs, authentication, and file storage.

In Figma Make, adding Payload replaces the project template and its instructions.

## Choose Payload Features

Use official Payload features only when needed; match plugin versions to Payload:

- Editor-managed public metadata: `seoPlugin` targeting the relevant collections
  or globals; render its `meta` fields and use `uploadsCollection` for social images.
- Administrator-defined forms: `formBuilderPlugin` with canonical `forms` and
  `form-submissions`; render configured fields and submit to that schema. Fixed
  application forms use ordinary collections.
- Durable asynchronous work: Payload Jobs with registered tasks, queueing,
  retries and persisted results. Keep immediate mutations synchronous.

Verify the authorized result read: field access must permit required data;
selections must include access-rule inputs; hidden fields require `showHiddenFields: true`.

## Payload Media Storage, Images, and Caching

Store CMS-managed images in an upload-enabled Payload collection and reference
its documents through upload relationships. Ingest remote starter files with
`externalURL` so editors can replace them through the same relationship. Do not
substitute parallel URL fields, hardcoded image arrays, or remote starter URLs.

Render `media.url` with `next/image`, useful alt text, and dimensions or a sized
`fill` parent. Keep the existing `figma-image-loader.ts`; do not add custom media
proxies, `images.remotePatterns`, raw `<img>` tags, or disable optimization.
Check image dimensions in each requested view and after upload replacement;
when publishing is requested, check the published site too.

Set cache headers through each upload collection's
[`upload.modifyResponseHeaders`](https://payloadcms.com/docs/upload/overview#modifying-response-headers):

- **Public cache:** only if `access.read` unconditionally returns `true` for
  every user, request, and document, and every file is intentionally public.
- **Otherwise:** explicitly set `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, including
  authenticated, filtered, mixed-access, missing, or unclear read rules.

CDN cache hits bypass Payload access checks. Keep protected files in a separate
collection with protected read access; never weaken access to enable caching.
Next.js route/page caching does not configure the storage CDN. Avoid `immutable`
for replaceable files unless their URLs change with their contents.

Public example (one hour; choose a lifetime appropriate to the app):

```ts
upload: {
  modifyResponseHeaders: ({ headers }) => {
    headers.set('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=3600')
    return headers
  },
},
```

Protected or unclear access (do not omit the header):

```ts
upload: {
  modifyResponseHeaders: ({ headers }) => {
    headers.set('Cache-Control', 'private, no-store')
    return headers
  },
},
```

## Essential Patterns

### Defaults & Conventions

Apply these defaults after classifying the collection's lifecycle:

- **Choose versions, drafts, and status from the lifecycle**, using the decision
  below. Do not apply editorial CMS defaults to every Payload collection.
- **Use native `slug` field type for slugs** instead of hand-rolling
  `{ name: 'slug', type: 'text', unique: true }`. The `slug` field type
  auto-generates URL-friendly slugs from a source field and handles
  uniqueness/indexing. `useAsSlug` is **required** — specify the source field
  name (e.g., `useAsSlug: 'title'` or `useAsSlug: 'name'`). Defaults to
  `required`, `unique`, `index: true`, and `position: 'sidebar'`.
- **`position: 'sidebar'` is for short, at-a-glance fields** — status, category,
  author, publish date. Avoid it for long fields that need horizontal space to be
  usable (description, rich text content, long text). Those belong in the main
  document area.
- **Use a stored top-level field for `admin.useAsTitle`.** Never set
  `admin.useAsTitle` to a computed field configured with `virtual: true`; these
  fields are not queryable and Payload rejects the configuration. A
  relationship-path virtual such as `virtual: 'author.name'` is supported, but
  use it only when the title must come from a related document.

### Choose Drafts, Versions, and Domain Status by Lifecycle

Payload stores both editorial content and durable application data. Classify each
collection or global by its real workflow before adding versioning or status:

- **Editorial publish/review workflow:** Use `versions: { drafts: true }` when
  editors need drafts, preview, review, scheduled publishing, or unpublished
  revisions. Payload injects `_status`, whose stored values are `draft` and
  `published`. “Changed” is a derived Admin UI state for published content with
  newer draft changes; it is not a stored `_status` value. Do not add a separate
  business `status` field merely to duplicate editorial publication state.
- **Operational or application records:** Do not enable drafts by default for
  records whose lifecycle is not editorial. If the domain has meaningful states
  such as pending, active, fulfilled, failed, cancelled, or archived, model them
  with an explicitly declared field such as `status`; do not overload `_status`.
- **Revision history without publishing:** Use `versions: true` (or a bounded
  versions configuration without `drafts`) when administrators need document
  history but there is no draft/publish workflow.
- **Immutable or append-only records:** Prefer immutable entries and explicit
  event/audit models over drafts. Do not turn an audit trail into editable draft
  versions.

If the workflow is unclear, use the simplest model and do not add drafts merely
because the data lives in Payload. Use `payload-data-modeling` to resolve the
domain lifecycle before editing the schema.

### Basic Collection

```ts
import type { CollectionConfig } from 'payload'

export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  admin: {
    useAsTitle: 'title',
    // _status (from versions.drafts) shows the draft/published state — no custom status field needed
    defaultColumns: ['title', 'author', '_status', 'createdAt'],
  },
  versions: {
    drafts: true,
  },
  fields: [
    { name: 'title', type: 'text', required: true },
    { name: 'slug', type: 'slug', useAsSlug: 'title' }, // native slug field — auto-generates from title, unique + indexed, sidebar position
    { name: 'content', type: 'richText' }, // long field — stays in the main area, not the sidebar
    // short, at-a-glance field — good sidebar candidate
    { name: 'author', type: 'relationship', relationTo: 'users', admin: { position: 'sidebar' } },
  ],
  timestamps: true,
}
```

For more collection patterns (auth, upload, drafts, live preview), see [COLLECTIONS.md](reference/COLLECTIONS.md).

### Common Fields

```ts
// Text field
{ name: 'title', type: 'text', required: true }

// Relationship
{ name: 'author', type: 'relationship', relationTo: 'users', required: true }

// Rich text
{ name: 'content', type: 'richText', required: true }

// Slug — use native slug field type, not a hand-rolled text field
{ name: 'slug', type: 'slug', useAsSlug: 'title' }

// Select (for taxonomy or a real domain workflow state; not editorial publish state)
{ name: 'category', type: 'select', options: ['news', 'tutorial', 'opinion'] }

// Upload
{ name: 'image', type: 'upload', relationTo: 'media' }
```

For all field types (array, blocks, point, join, virtual, conditional, etc.), see [FIELDS.md](reference/FIELDS.md).

### Hook Example

Hooks live at one of two levels and they are not interchangeable. **Collection hooks** receive `{ doc, data, req, operation, ... }` and act on the whole document. **Field hooks** live inside an individual field's `hooks` object, receive `{ value, siblingData, ... }`, and **return the new value** for that field. Computed/virtual fields, per-field formatters, and per-field access masking are field hooks; cross-field business logic is a collection hook.

```ts
// Collection-level: business logic across the document
export const Posts: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'posts',
  hooks: {
    beforeChange: [
      async ({ data, operation }) => {
        if (operation === 'create') {
          data.slug = slugify(data.title)
        }
        return data
      },
    ],
  },
  fields: [{ name: 'title', type: 'text' }],
}

// Field-level: compute / format a single field's value (virtual fields use this)
export const Users: CollectionConfig = {
  slug: 'users',
  fields: [
    { name: 'firstName', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'lastName', type: 'text' },
    {
      name: 'fullName',
      type: 'text',
      virtual: true,
      hooks: {
        afterRead: [({ siblingData }) => `${siblingData.firstName} ${siblingData.lastName}`],
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

When asked to "compute a field" or "populate a field's value in a hook", use a **field-level** hook on that field — never a collection-level `afterRead` that mutates `doc`.

For all hook patterns, see [HOOKS.md](reference/HOOKS.md). For access control, see [ACCESS-CONTROL.md](reference/ACCESS-CONTROL.md).

### Access Control with Type Safety

```ts
import type { Access } from 'payload'
import type { User } from '@/payload-types'

// Type-safe access control
export const adminOnly: Access = ({ req }) => {
  const user = req.user as User
  return user?.roles?.includes('admin') || false
}

// Row-level access control
export const ownPostsOnly: Access = ({ req }) => {
  const user = req.user as User
  if (!user) return false
  if (user.roles?.includes('admin')) return true

  return {
    author: { equals: user.id },
  }
}
```

### Query Example

```ts
// Local API (collection uses versions.drafts, so query _status for draft/published state)
const posts = await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  overrideAccess: true,
  where: {
    _status: { equals: 'published' },
    'author.name': { contains: 'john' },
  },
  depth: 2,
  limit: 10,
  sort: '-createdAt',
})

// Query with populated relationships
const post = await payload.findByID({
  collection: 'posts',
  overrideAccess: true,
  id: '123',
  depth: 2, // Populates relationships (default is 2)
})
// Returns: { author: { id: "user123", name: "John" } }

// Without depth, relationships return IDs only
const post = await payload.findByID({
  collection: 'posts',
  overrideAccess: true,
  id: '123',
  depth: 0,
})
// Returns: { author: "user123" }
```

For all query operators and REST/GraphQL examples, see [QUERIES.md](reference/QUERIES.md).

### Getting Payload Instance

```ts
// In API routes (Next.js)
import { getPayload } from 'payload'
import config from '@payload-config'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const payload = await getPayload({ config })
  const { user } = await payload.auth({ headers: request.headers })

  const posts = await payload.find({
    collection: 'posts',
    overrideAccess: false, // this route answers for whoever called it
    user,
  })

  return Response.json(posts)
}

// In Server Components
import { headers } from 'next/headers'
import { getPayload } from 'payload'
import config from '@payload-config'

export default async function Page() {
  const payload = await getPayload({ config })
  const { user } = await payload.auth({ headers: await headers() })
  const { docs } = await payload.find({
    collection: 'posts',
    overrideAccess: false,
    user,
  })

  return <div>{docs.map(post => <h1 key={post.id}>{post.title}</h1>)}</div>
}
```

## Implementation Planning

### Choose Route Lifecycles Before Editing

Before writing a public Payload query, list each route and its lifecycle in your
plan. Use these defaults:

- If the user explicitly requests a build-time snapshot, keep the route static
  and tell them to click Publish in Figma Make after Payload edits.
- Cache public blog, magazine, and other editorial list/detail routes unless
  the user explicitly asks for request-time or live rendering. Asking to manage
  content in Payload is not an opt-in to uncached rendering.
- Render frequently changing operational routes at request time.
- Keep fixed informational routes static.

Do not choose request-time rendering merely because it makes freshness easier
or avoids writing invalidation hooks. Use it only for an explicitly live route
or a genuinely high-churn operational workflow; when unsure, treat public
article list/detail routes as cached editorial content.

For cached Payload routes, use `unstable_cache` and add both `afterChange`
and `afterDelete` invalidation. Cover the list plus the current, previous,
and deleted detail locations; use `previousDoc` for slug changes. A time-based
`revalidate` interval alone is incomplete.

## Security Pitfalls

### 1. Local API Access Control (CRITICAL)

**Always pass `overrideAccess` explicitly on every Local API call.** `overrideAccess: true` bypasses ALL access control, even when a user is passed.

```ts
// ❌ SECURITY BUG: Passes user but bypasses their permissions anyway
await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  user: someUser,
  overrideAccess: true, // Access control is BYPASSED!
})

// ✅ SECURE: User's permissions are enforced
await payload.find({
  collection: 'posts',
  user: someUser,
  overrideAccess: false, // Respects the user's access control
})
```

Three modes:

- **Admin** — `overrideAccess: true`: bypasses access control. Trusted server ops (cron, seeds, migrations, hooks doing system work).
- **Anonymous** (uncommon) — `overrideAccess: false`, no user: runs the collection `read` access as anonymous. Public reads need `read` to return published-only for non-auth'd users; using Admin mode instead ⚠️ bypasses the filter, so drafts can render publicly.
- **On behalf of user** — `overrideAccess: false` + `user`: inherits the user's access. API routes, webhooks.

### 2. Transaction Failures in Hooks

**Nested operations in hooks without `req` break transaction atomicity.**

```ts
// ❌ DATA CORRUPTION RISK: Separate transaction
hooks: {
  afterChange: [
    async ({ doc, req }) => {
      await req.payload.create({
        collection: 'audit-log',
        overrideAccess: true,
        data: { docId: doc.id },
        // Missing req - runs in separate transaction!
      })
    },
  ]
}

// ✅ ATOMIC: Same transaction
hooks: {
  afterChange: [
    async ({ doc, req }) => {
      await req.payload.create({
        collection: 'audit-log',
        overrideAccess: true,
        data: { docId: doc.id },
        req, // Maintains atomicity
      })
    },
  ]
}
```

### 3. Infinite Hook Loops

**Hooks triggering operations that trigger the same hooks create infinite loops.**

```ts
// ❌ INFINITE LOOP
hooks: {
  afterChange: [
    async ({ doc, req }) => {
      await req.payload.update({
        collection: 'posts',
        overrideAccess: true,
        id: doc.id,
        data: { views: doc.views + 1 },
        req,
      }) // Triggers afterChange again!
    },
  ]
}

// ✅ SAFE: Use context flag
hooks: {
  afterChange: [
    async ({ doc, req, context }) => {
      if (context.skipHooks) return

      await req.payload.update({
        collection: 'posts',
        overrideAccess: true,
        id: doc.id,
        data: { views: doc.views + 1 },
        context: { skipHooks: true },
        req,
      })
    },
  ]
}
```

## Building & Type Generation

Payload generates `payload-types.ts` for you — you rarely need to run `generate:types` by hand.

- **During development:** `typescript.autoGenerate` defaults to `true`, so the dev
  server regenerates types automatically whenever your config changes. Don't run
  `generate:types` manually while the dev server is running — it's redundant.
- **During builds:** `payload build` generates the import map and types before
  running `next build`. Prefer it over calling `next build` directly so neither is
  ever stale. Pass `--no-types` to skip type generation.
- **Manual generation** (`payload generate:types`) is an escape hatch — only when
  neither the dev server nor a build is in the loop (e.g. a one-off script, or CI
  before a step that doesn't run `payload build`).

```ts
// payload.config.ts
export default buildConfig({
  typescript: {
    outputFile: path.resolve(dirname, 'payload-types.ts'),
    // autoGenerate defaults to true — types regenerate in dev automatically
  },
})

// Usage
import type { Post, User } from '@/payload-types'
```

## Common Gotchas

1. **Always pass `overrideAccess` explicitly** on Local API calls — use `true` only for trusted server-side work
2. **Missing `req` in nested operations** breaks transaction atomicity
3. **Hook loops** — operations in hooks can re-trigger the same hooks; use `req.context` flags
4. **Field-level access** returns boolean only, no query constraints
5. **Relationship depth** defaults to 2; set `depth: 0` for IDs only
6. **Draft status** — `_status` field is auto-injected when drafts are enabled
7. **Types regenerate automatically** in dev (`autoGenerate`) and during `payload build` — avoid running `generate:types` manually
8. **MongoDB transactions** require replica set configuration
9. **SQLite transactions** are disabled by default; enable with `transactionOptions: {}`
10. **Point fields** are not supported in SQLite
11. **Computed virtual titles** — fields configured with `virtual: true` cannot be used in `admin.useAsTitle`; use a stored top-level field
12. **Generated array types are nullable** — Generated Payload types mark array fields as `T[] | null`, but destructuring defaults like `= []` only handle `undefined`. Use `?? []` after destructuring:
   ```ts
   // ❌ FAILS with strict null checks — destructuring default doesn't handle null
   const { items = [] } = block

   // ✅ CORRECT — nullish coalescing handles both null and undefined
   const { items } = block
   const safeItems = items ?? []

   // Or inline:
   const items = block.items ?? []
   ```

## Best Practices

### Content and Data Modeling

- Apply [the lifecycle decision](#choose-drafts-versions-and-domain-status-by-lifecycle)
  before adding versions, drafts, `_status` queries, or a domain `status` field
- Use native `slug` field type (`{ type: 'slug', useAsSlug: 'title' }`) for slugs
  instead of hand-rolling a unique text field
- Use a stored top-level field for `admin.useAsTitle`; never use a computed
  `virtual: true` field as the title
- Reserve `position: 'sidebar'` for short, at-a-glance fields (status, category,
  author, date); keep long fields (description, rich text) in the main area

### Security

- Default to restrictive access, gradually add permissions
- Use `overrideAccess: false` whenever the call acts for a user, and pass that `user`
- Field-level access only returns boolean (no query constraints)
- Never trust client-provided data
- Use `saveToJWT: true` for roles to avoid database lookups

### Performance

- Index frequently queried fields
- Use `select` to limit returned fields
- Set `maxDepth` on relationships to prevent over-fetching
- Prefer query constraints over async operations in access control
- Cache expensive operations in `req.context`

### Data Integrity

- Always pass `req` to nested operations in hooks
- Use context flags to prevent infinite hook loops
- Enable transactions for MongoDB (requires replica set) and Postgres
- Use `beforeValidate` for data formatting
- Use `beforeChange` for business logic

### Type Safety

- Let dev (`autoGenerate`) and `payload build` generate types; run `generate:types` manually only when neither is running
- Import types from generated `payload-types.ts`
- Type your user object: `import type { User } from '@/payload-types'`
- Use field type guards for runtime type checking
- When extracting any Payload value into a named constant — a collection, field, hook, access function, plugin, etc. — annotate it with the matching Payload type (`CollectionConfig`, `Field`, `CollectionBeforeChangeHook`, `Access`, `Plugin`, …) or use `satisfies <Type>`. Without an annotation, string properties like `type: 'text'` widen to `string` and discriminated unions (`Field`, `CollectionConfig`) fail to resolve. Inline literals get this for free via contextual typing; extracted constants do not.
- **Handle nullable arrays correctly**: Generated types mark array fields as `T[] | null`. Always use `?? []` (nullish coalescing) after destructuring, never rely on destructuring defaults `= []` which only handle `undefined`

### Organization

- Keep collections in separate files
- Extract access control to `access/` directory
- Extract hooks to `hooks/` directory
- Use reusable field factories for common patterns
- Document complex access control with comments

## Completion Audit

Run this audit before reporting any application-changing task complete, and
check every applicable item:

- When an unauthenticated public route reads Payload with
  `overrideAccess: false`, give the collection an explicit public `access.read`
  policy for the records that route may expose. Do not assume omitted access is
  public.
- Seed requested starter documents through the Payload MCP workflow and verify
  them with a separate read or count. Do not leave an uncalled seed endpoint or
  ask the user to seed the delivered app manually.
- When `useTransition` calls a Server Action, keep `revalidatePath` out of the
  action. Return a serializable result, then call `router.refresh()` on success.
- Use `next/image` for application content images, with useful alt text and
  dimensions or a sized `fill` parent. For Payload uploads, pass `media.url`
  through the project's custom image loader (`figma-image-loader.ts`). Do
  not add a same-origin `/media/[id]` proxy, replace `Image` with raw
  `<img>`, disable optimization globally, or add `images.remotePatterns`
  when a custom loader is already configured.
- Build application UI with the project's configured styling system from the
  first edit. Do not prototype static styling with inline style objects and plan
  to clean it up later. Keep inline styles only for values computed at runtime
  that the styling system cannot express.
- With `next/font`, do not set both a fixed `weight` and variable `axes`; omit
  one or the other as required by the font.
- Before finishing UI, search changed source for raw `<img>`, non-computed
  inline `style` objects, and event handlers in Server Components. Convert
  content images and static styles to the project conventions, and move
  interactive elements behind a Client Component boundary or use CSS
  interaction. Review every result from
  `rg '<img|style=\{\{' src/app src/components`: only computed style values may
  remain, and a utility font class must not be duplicated by `fontFamily`.
- For rendering or caching work, track production rendering evidence as its own
  pending completion todo, separate from any general verification, testing, or
  bootstrap todo. It stays pending until both halves are observed: every public
  route is classified static, cached, or request-time from the production route
  table, and a unique content mutation is visible to a fresh production request
  for each route the change affects. Source inspection, a dev preview,
  `verify-bootstrap`, and final-response claims cannot complete it.
- For rendering or caching work, run `figma make verify-deploy` and inspect the
  production route table. This uses the Make workload's managed environment;
  raw `pnpm build` in the interactive shell may not. A green development
  bootstrap is not production-build evidence. Never finish while the preview
  shows a Build Error. In the final response, name each public route as static,
  cached, or request-time and explain how a later visitor sees Payload edits.
  For cached routes, summarize the tags and mutation hooks. Report the observed
  verification result instead of inferring it from source.
